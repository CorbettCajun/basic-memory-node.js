# Basic Memory Node.js Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for bringing the Node.js implementation of Basic Memory to feature parity with the original Python version. The roadmap is organized into phases with specific tasks, priorities, and completion criteria to track progress effectively.

> **CRITICAL NOTE: Data Structure Compatibility**

> It is of utmost importance that the Node.js implementation maintains **exact** compatibility with the Python version in terms of:

- Database schema structure and relationships
- Entity and relationship modeling
- Variable naming and dictionary structures
- Cross-referencing methods
- Metadata formats and serialization
- Front matter parsing and storage
- Link relationship storage

> Since both implementations may potentially use the same database and/or Markdown files, any divergence in data structures or storage methods could corrupt shared data. All implementation decisions must be verified against the Python version to ensure perfect compatibility.

- PRs cannot be merged without passing all automated tests
- Version tags will be created at each 25% phase completion milestone
- After completion validation, changes must be pushed to the source repository within 24 hours
- Commit messages must follow the format: `[Phase X.Y] Brief description of change`
- Weekly synchronization with source repository is required even for work-in-progress features

**Version Tracking Schedule:**
- Minor version increments (0.x.0) at each phase completion
- Patch version increments (0.0.x) at each 25% milestone within a phase
- Major version increments (x.0.0) when reaching production-ready status

These verification protocols will be applied to all phases of the roadmap to ensure accurate progress tracking and to maintain the integrity of the compatibility requirements between implementations.
